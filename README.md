Genetic Algorithm Project:

Generally,the goal of our project is to improve neural network using genetic algorithm. The basic question we are going to solve is the classic MINST digit number classification using BP nerual network. Instead of using the XAVIER or other method to initiate the weights for each model, we radomly choose the initial weights for the first generation of the classifiers and let the genetic algorithm select the best initial weights for the model. Finally, we compared the perfomance of our model to others which trained the model straightly.
