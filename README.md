# INFO6205_304 Genetic Algorithm Project

Breif Introduction

Since weight initialization can have a profound impact on both the convergence rate and final quality of a network and Genetic Algorithm is a very useful approach on NP hard problem, we created a genetic algorithm to improve weight initialization for back propagation neural network. The problem our neural network is trying to solve is a classical recognition problem on iris flower. There are four decimal numbers as input data which represent the features of three types of iris flower, and the trained model is used to recognize the type of an iris flower. 

The data set we used is public in the UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris.
